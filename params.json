Various static analysis and dynamic testing techniques have been proposed to detect buffer overflow vulnerabilities. With automatic tool support, static buffer overflow detection technique has been widely used in academia and industry. However, it tends to report too many false positives fundamentally due to the lack of software execution information. Currently, static warnings can only be validated by manual inspection, which significantly limits the practicality of the static analysis. In this paper, we present BovInspector, a tool framework for automatic static buffer overflow warnings inspection and valid bugs repair. Given the program source code and static buffer overflow vulnerability warnings, BovInspector first performs warning reachability analysis. Then, BovInspector executes the source code symbolically under the guidance of reachable warnings. Each reachable warning is validated and classified by checking whether all the path conditions and the buffer overflow constraints can be satisfied simultaneously. For each validated true warning, BovInspector fix it by adding boundary checking or replacing unsafe APIs by safe ones. BovInspector is complementary to prior static buffer overflow discovery schemes. Experimental results on real open source programs show that BovInspector can automatically inspect 74.9\\% of total warnings in average, and identify from 25\\% to 100\\% of the false warnings with an average of 59.9\\%. And a short video for demonstrating the capabilities of BovInspector is now available at https://youtu.be/bAgZ4b5AWR8.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>\r\n<a id=\"designer-templates\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#designer-templates\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>Overview</h3>\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BovInspectorTool/project/gh-pages/images/arc.png\"  alt=\"overview\" width=\"250\" height=\"355\"/>\r\n<p>BovInspector has\r\ntwo inputs, the static buffer overflow vulnerability warnings\r\nand the source code, and three outputs, true warnings, false\r\nwarnings, and undecided warnings. True warnings are those\r\nthat there exists at least one test case that triggers buffer over-\r\nflow. For each true warning, BovInspector also outputs such a\r\ntest case. In addition, BovInspector can automatically repair\r\nthe vulnerabilities for validated true warnings by checking\r\narray boundaries or replacing unsafe API by safe ones. False\r\nwarnings are those that there exists no test case that triggers\r\nbuffer overflow or totally unreachable. For such warnings, no\r\nhuman inspection is needed. Undecidable warnings are those\r\nthat BovInspector can neither find a test case to trigger buffer\r\noverflow nor prove that no such test case exists within a\r\ngiven time limit. The optimization goal of BovInspector is to\r\nminimize the number of undecided warnings. Ideally, we want\r\nto minimize the number of undecidable warnings to zero for all\r\nprograms; however, this is theoretically impossible because of\r\nthe problem of using one program to find non-trivial properties\r\nof another program is fundamentally undecided.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>\r\n<a id=\"tool\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#creating-pages-manually\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>Tool</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We implemented BovInspector on <a href=\"http://klee.github.io/\">KLEE</a>, a state-of-the-art symbolic execution engine built on top of the <a href=\"http://llvm.org/\">LLVM compiler\r\ninfrastructure</a>. We extended functions of klee from two directions: guided symbolic execution and buffer overflow validation.The static buffer overflow detector used in our experiments is HP Fortify version 3.2.\r\nWe used <a href=\"https://github.com/BovInspectorTool/project/blob/master/bin/fvdlParser.rar\">fvdlParser</a> to convert the results of Fortify into static buffer overflow warning.\r\nWe uesd <a href=\"https://github.com/BovInspectorTool/project/blob/master/bin/buildCFG.rar\">buildCFG.so</a> which is complied by LLVM pass to build CFG ,analyse reachablity in the graph and get warning path set.\r\nWe modified source code of klee to inspect buffer overflow warnings.With the position of buffer overflow in the \r\nsource code, we used <a href=\"https://github.com/BovInspectorTool/project/blob/master/src/repair buffer overflow/repair.py\">repair.py</a> to repair the vulnerability.You can download the source code from <a href=\"https://github.com/BovInspectorTool/project\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>\r\n<a id=\"authors-and-contributors\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#authors-and-contributors\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>Experiment</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>All experiments were conducted on a quad-core machine\r\nwith an Intel Core (TM) Corei5-2400 3.10GHz processor and\r\n4G memory, running Linux 3.11.0.To evaluate our method, we designed two sets of experiments. The first set of experiments\r\nis designed to evaluate the correctness and accuracy of our method. The second set of experiments is designed to check\r\nthe scalability and effectiveness of our method for real-world open source programs. Through these experiments, we hope to\r\nanswer the following key research questions: (1) How much effort can a developer save by validating buffer overflow warnings\r\nusing our technique(2) How does our technique perform on large-scale, real-world applications (3) How efficient is our\r\ntechnique.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>\r\n<a id=\"case\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#support-or-contact\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>Case</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You may download testcase via the <a href=\"https://github.com/BovInspectorTool/project/blob/master/testcases/testcases.rar\">download page</a>.</p>\r\n      \r\n<h3>\r\n<a id=\"tutorial\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#support-or-contact\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>Tutorial</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You can see turotial <a href=\"http://bovinspectortool.github.io/project/tutorial.html\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n  </body>\r\n</html>",
